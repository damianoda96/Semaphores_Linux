To run main.c, compile with the following command: 
'gcc main.c -o main -lpthread -lrt'
To run the program, use the command './main'.

The program simulates the time of smoking and making cigarettes by using sleep commands, it will continue until each of the 6 smokers have smoked 3 cigarettes. The program takes 20-30 seconds to run fully. I have numbered the smokers so we can verify that indeed each smoker does smoke 3 cigarettes.
